                        <br><br>
                        My artwork is willpower and flow. Willpower represents relying on my inner strength to push
                        through the struggles of self-defeating, mental fatigue, and procrastination. Flow is finding my
                        balance of enjoying what I create and finding a common ground that leads the enjoyment into
                        excitement rather than using willpower or force. 2020 has put me and other artists in a
                        self-defeating mental state. As this pandemic continues, being on Zoom calls and doing class
                        homework 8 hours are more does more harm than productivity. <br> <br>

                        Start in Project 1, I explore A-frame to make an experience of a virtual roller coaster mixed in
                        with the pandemic toilet paper madness. I incorporate and explore scales, motion, sound, and
                        interactive movement through Web Vr. Motion is used in the three-ring to create an illusion of a
                        blur and busy reality with things coming at you. The head is used as a representation of being
                        stuck in daily tasks. The eerie stimulating sound help speeds up anxiety and stress level which
                        causes more overall fatigue. Last but not least, noticed there is a sand dial as a
                        representation of time. Feeling of isolation, anxiety, procrastination, and being on a grind due
                        to the workload.

                        <br><br>

                        For Project 2, I utilize A-frame, Sketchfab, and/or three js to help with this work. Diving
                        deeper into A-frame this time, I created a live web browser garden for everyone to access and be
                        aware of the dichotomy of online learning. I speak on the technology being a double edge sword
                        where one can gain comfort working from home but that costs us human social interaction and gain
                        no further guidance from our teachers and friends since we are all alone. Unlike the first
                        project for an immersive VR space, this project is more so of an online wall installation due to
                        the physical limitation of the viewer. This gallery wall is right in front and the message is in
                        the center. I took this opportunity to create something more simple for accessibility and having
                        traditional (painting) art mixed with a live virtual event (wallflower) art.


                        <br><br>
                        Last, in Project 3, I look to Carsten Holler and Bill Viola for my inspiration. Most of
                        Carsten's work involves interactive spatial art such as giant mushroom upside-down sculptures
                        where you can navigate around in the physical space. In that piece, he used movement, visual,
                        and spatial to force the audience to interact with his artwork. The second person was Bill
                        Viola, who focuses on human consciousness and uses digital video to express his work. Both
                        embodied the concept of interaction based storytelling artwork through experience and
                        sensations. This gave me an idea to explore the idea of creating an online theme park since a
                        physical one is not possible. I started off again with the basics of A-Frame building my
                        foundation up to explore deeper concept and scalability. I've found common threads between
                        Bill's and Carsten's work to draw inspiration from. First, it has to be interaction, and second,
                        it has to be video. I took this opportunity to explore the concept of python turtle generative
                        art. I found tutorials online that would teach me how to set up the environment and figure out
                        the coding part. Python turtle is a library of python to make visual shapes and graphs. I spend
                        the time to record my process and edit the video of those outputted codes. I would use those
                        videos and visuals for my A-Frame theme park on the web as a feature piece to the online park.
                        The end result was an engaging visual output of multiple shapes with tacky colors and a video
                        recorded from the work. Last but not least, I got to learned A-Frame and Python to make an
                        online park that incorporates video and interaction-based artwork for my project 3 related to
                        willpower and flow.
